There are certainly things I like about the Zero Dollar Laptop project. I like that it’s trying to take away power from institutions with money and power and without the best interest of people at heart. I like that it’s resisting the consumerist urge that capitalism implanted within us for the newest and shiniest thing. I agree that laptops are useful for more than just education purposes and that, unless something is *actually free* (or very close to it, for whatever debatable and arbitrary value that may be) it won’t actually be all that accessible. I agree that, while laptops are useful and therefore marketable through their portability, their short lifespans mean that the corporations making them have more incentive to sell them instead of powerful desktops. 

Yet, I’m still uncomfortable with it. Like, does putting Linux on our old laptops need to be emphasized as a radical political statement? For what value of ‘political’ is being used here? I have an old laptop that I want to put linux on because it’s a good laptop and I want to be able to use it for my own purposes, mainly writing. But is doing so part of a grand revolt against the capitalist systems that currently run our lives? I think that the author of this manifesto would argue yes, because under capitalism you are always obliged to give up your capital, whether it’s money or time or resources, to the people who own the means of production or whatever. It’s a worldview that I certainly sympathise with. 

But… how much of a revolt is my one Zero Dollar Laptop going to be? I don’t really plan on replacing the OS on my main laptop, and I even plan on constructing a new desktop with goddamn Windows on it because I want a platform where I can play games. And I really don’t want to build a giant desktop tower in order to fiddle with WINE or something. Windows is the native environment for a wide variety of games, and I’m not ready to give up that part of one of my core hobbies just so that I can feel good about myself being pure to the vision of the Open Source Future. 

This is my main qualm with the Zero Dollar Laptop project: it talks really big for a project that seems so small. “Change the way society is run! Revolt against your capitalist oppressors! And to do that, put Linux on your laptop I guess!” It’s tiny! I get that some people feel that the best way to commit revolution is by small degrees, and that this project fits into a larger theoretical framework where the masses change the systems that govern them. But for the thing that is being advocated for, it comes off as self-indulgent pomposity. I can justify putting Linux on my laptop a thousand different ways, and the most pretentious one of them is “I’m fighting against the system, man!”

I have other qualms about this project, but those run into some broader criticisms of utopic anarchic visions of the future, like my hesitation to embrace the kind of decentralization that people like this advocate for. But that’s beyond the scope of this response.
